# A Comparison of Recommendation Models for Amazon's Movie and TV Catalog
This two-part project explores the performance of various collaborative filtering methods for inferring user-item ratings for Amazon's film and TV catalog. [Part I](https://github.com/zhao1701/amazon-movie-recommendation/tree/master/part-01) surveys the effectiveness of various traditional recommendation methods by testing their performance on varying-sized samples of the Amazon Movie and TV Reviews dataset, while [Part II](https://github.com/zhao1701/amazon-movie-recommendation/tree/master/part-02), an indirect extension of Part I, focuses on optimizing the performance of a number of more modern techniques.
